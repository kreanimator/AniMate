# AniMate

A Blender plugin for animating humanoid rigs using motion capture data from MediaPipe.

## Features

- Real-time motion capture using MediaPipe
- Support for pose, face, and hand tracking
- Modular, extensible architecture with clear separation of detection, mapping, rig, UI, and utility logic
- Configurable bone mappings for Mixamo, Rigify, and Maya rigs

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **Under Development** ðŸš§

The project is currently in active development. Core functionality is implemented but may have bugs or missing features.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kreanimator/AniMate.git
cd AniMate
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Package the Blender addon:
```bash
bash package_addon.sh
```
This will create `animate_addon.zip` in your project root.

4. Install the Blender addon:
   - Open Blender
   - Go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons
   - Click "Install" and select the `animate_addon.zip` file you just created
   - Enable the addon by checking the box next to "Animation: AniMate"

## Manual Dependency Installation (for Snap/Flatpak/Custom Blender)

**Important:** If you are using Blender from Snap, Flatpak, or a custom build, you must manually install all dependencies from `requirements.txt` into Blender's Python environment.

### Steps:
1. Find Blender's Python executable:
   ```bash
   blender --background --python-expr "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
   # Example output: /home/youruser/snap/blender-4.3.2-linux-x64/4.3/python/bin/python3.11
   ```
2. Find Blender's site-packages directory:
   ```bash
   blender --background --python-expr "import site; print(site.getsitepackages()[0])"
   # Example output: /home/youruser/snap/blender-4.3.2-linux-x64/4.3/python/lib/python3.11/site-packages
   ```
3. For each dependency in `requirements.txt`, run:
   ```bash
   /path/to/blender/python/bin/python3.11 -m pip install --target=/path/to/blender/python/lib/python3.11/site-packages <package>
   # Example:
   /home/youruser/snap/blender-4.3.2-linux-x64/4.3/python/bin/python3.11 -m pip install --target=/home/youruser/snap/blender-4.3.2-linux-x64/4.3/python/lib/python3.11/site-packages packaging
   /home/youruser/snap/blender-4.3.2-linux-x64/4.3/python/bin/python3.11 -m pip install --target=/home/youruser/snap/blender-4.3.2-linux-x64/4.3/python/lib/python3.11/site-packages opencv-python
   /home/youruser/snap/blender-4.3.2-linux-x64/4.3/python/bin/python3.11 -m pip install --target=/home/youruser/snap/blender-4.3.2-linux-x64/4.3/python/lib/python3.11/site-packages mediapipe
   /home/youruser/snap/blender-4.3.2-linux-x64/4.3/python/bin/python3.11 -m pip install --target=/home/youruser/snap/blender-4.3.2-linux-x64/4.3/python/lib/python3.11/site-packages Pillow
   ```

**Note:** You must repeat this for every dependency in `requirements.txt`.

## Module Overview

- **bpy_ui/**: All Blender UI logic (panels, operators, properties). Defines the AniMate panel, capture controls, and user settings.
- **detection/**: MediaPipe-based detection logic for pose, hands, and face. Provides real-time landmark extraction.
- **mapping/**: Rig mapping classes for Mixamo, Rigify, and Maya. Handles bone hierarchy, landmark-to-bone mapping, axis corrections, and rotation limits.
- **rig/**: Core rig management, driver creation, and transfer logic. Handles driver empties, constraints, and applying landmark data to the rig.
- **utils/**: Math and coordinate transformation utilities for converting MediaPipe data to Blender space.

## Usage

### In Blender

1. Open Blender and load your humanoid rig
2. In the 3D Viewport, open the sidebar (N key)
3. Go to the "AniMate" tab
4. Select your armature in the "Target Armature" field
5. Configure detection settings (pose, face, hands)
6. Click "Start Capture" to begin motion capture
7. Landmarks will be drawn on the camera preview, and the rig will animate in real time if mapping is correct

## Modularity & Extensibility

AniMate is designed for easy extension:
- Add new rig types by creating a new mapping class in `mapping/` and registering it in `mapping_factory.py`.
- Add new detection logic in `detection/`.
- Extend the UI by adding new panels or operators in `bpy_ui/`.
- Add math or coordinate utilities in `utils/`.

## Packaging and Installing the Addon in Blender

To install this addon in Blender, you need to package all required folders into a single zip file. Use the provided shell script:

1. Open a terminal in your project root.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   bash package_addon.sh
   ```
3. This will create `animate_addon.zip` in your project root.
4. In Blender, go to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install`, and select `animate_addon.zip`.
5. Enable the addon in the list.

**The script will include:**
- `animate_addon/` (main addon code)
- `rig/` (rig logic and mappings)
- `data/` (any data files needed)

If you add more dependencies (like `utils/` or `examples/`), uncomment the relevant lines in `package_addon.sh`.

## Test Scene for Blender Development

A sample Blender file is provided for development and testing:

- **data/sample_scene_with_mixamo_rig.blend**

This file contains a human mesh with a Mixamo rig and can be used as a test scene for AniMate development in Blender. Load this file to quickly test the addon with a compatible rig and mesh setup.

## Planned Features & Future Releases

AniMate is actively evolving! Planned features for future releases include:

- **Motion capture from image/video files**: Animate rigs using prerecorded video or image sequences, not just live camera input.
- **Multiple rig type support**: Seamless switching and mapping for Mixamo, Rigify, Maya, and custom rigs.
- **Locked posing and region isolation**: Lock specific bones or regions (e.g., hands, feet, head) to prevent unwanted movement during capture.
- **Improved UI/UX**: More intuitive controls, status indicators, and capture feedback.
- **Advanced retargeting and smoothing**: Better motion smoothing, filtering, and retargeting options.
- **Batch processing and automation**: Tools for automating capture and animation workflows.
- **More extensibility hooks**: Easier ways for developers to add new rig types, mappings, or detection modes.
